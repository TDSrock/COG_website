# [](#header-1)Community of Oceanic Gamers Forum website

This repo contains a forum website built for the Community of Oceanic Gamers. A community started by my Australian mate Cameron "AUSSIEPRO" Warton. The website leverages the basis from MyBB 1.8.10 and a number of add-ons avaible for MyBB 1.8.10. As a part of managing the website I drasticly changed the CSS and website structure aswell as updated some of the add-ons as they in certain cases had bugs within their PHP code.
